                <h2>You’ll each take turns contributing to the conversation. After Erica says or asks something, you’ll be provided with three possible responses. Choose the response that demonstrates you are listening to Erica and trying to understand her life from her perspective. This skill is also known as empathy and is an important element of establishing trust. I’ll offer some feedback on your choices and identify basic listening skills as we go along.</h2>
